		<td><ul><li>Carbon is a Group 14 element and is distributed very widely in nature.<li>It is a component of rocks as carbonates of calcium (limestone), magnesium, and iron.<li> The atmosphere of Mars is very thin but what there is contains about 95 % CO2.<li>Carbon is unique among the elements in the vast number of variety of compounds it can form. <li>Organic chemistry, a 1/112th subset of inorganic chemistry, is the study of carbon and its compounds. <li>While silicon might take the place of carbon in forming a host of related compounds, it is not<br> possible currently to form stable compounds with very long chains of silicon atoms.<li>Carbon is found free in nature in three allotropic forms: amorphous, graphite, and diamond.<li> Graphite is one of the softest known materials while diamond is one of the hardest.</li></ul></td></tr>
